# ML
Repo to store references, notes (see all .md files) and code done on my journey to learn machine learning.

**ISLP** refers to *Introduction to Statiscal Learning with Python*, a free course I am taking from Stanford via edX. This course is more focused on mathematical concepts and basic models.

**MaO** refers to *Mãos à Obra: Aprendizado de Máquina com Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow: Conceitos, Ferramentas e Técnicas Para a Construção de Sistemas Inteligentes*, a book more focused on actual implementation and usage of ML.

**Papers** refers to the research I am conducting on class overlap.
